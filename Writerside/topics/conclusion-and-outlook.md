# Conclusion and Outlook

In conclusion, the project successfully fulfilled all the must-have, most of the should-have, and some of the
nice-to-have requirements, delivering a production-ready transit routing solution.

One of the key strengths of this project is that the final product is available as open-source under the MIT license,
which encourages future contributions and improvements. Additionally, the teamâ€™s strong motivation were vital to our
success, resulting in a productive development process enriched by a compelling and challenging topic. The iterative
approach we adopted, along with careful task management, ensured efficiency, even with extensive pull request reviews.
This not only maintained high code quality but also resulted in solid design decisions and robust testing practices,
which proved beneficial in the long run. Each team member expanded their expertise in key areas, including data
structures and algorithms, language specifics, and software architecture, contributing to substantial knowledge gains.

However, there were areas for improvement. One notable challenge was the minimal overlap between the C++ and Java
components, which led to reduced synergy during the development process. Additionally, the intense project schedule,
with long hours spent coding during evenings and weekends, placed considerable strain on the personal lives of the team
members, highlighting a work-life balance issue.

Looking to the future, several areas of potential development could further enhance the product. Introducing fare-based
multi-criteria routing through mcRAPTOR could offer users more tailored, cost-effective options. Incorporating real-time
GTFS updates would make the system more responsive to current conditions, improving its accuracy. Implementing
A*-based routing for footpaths would enhance the precision of walking routes between transit stops. Implementing a
common storage architecture for loaded schedules and router stop times within the public transit service
would enhance horizontal scalability and encapsulate the state within a new, dedicated data layer.

Overall, we believe this project has established a strong foundation for future development. As we conclude our MAS in
Software Engineering at the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences, we are excited to see how the project
evolves and progresses in the future.
