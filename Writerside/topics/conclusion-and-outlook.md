# Conclusion and Outlook

Concluding it can be stated, that all must-have requirements are fully satisfied.

In comparison to the RAPTOR implementation (*SwissRailRaptor*) of Rieser et al. [10], our achieved performance is quite
good, though slightly slower on the public transit schedule for the entirety of Switzerland. This difference is
acceptable given that our solution focuses on real-world production use cases, such as handling different service days,
accessibility, bike information, multi-day trips, and latest departure routes. In contrast, their router is optimized
for simulation efficiency within the MATSim framework.
